    "### **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I utilized Google’s Gemini model to develop an intelligent system for financial document analysis and personalized loan advisory, addressing a pressing issue in Kenya’s financial landscape as reported by a kenyan bank analysis report,I know this is not an issue facing this country only its world wide: the **rising rate of non-performing loans**. With more individuals and businesses struggling to repay loans—partly due to economic uncertainty and poor financial planning—there is an urgent need for smarter, data-driven tools that can both inform lending decisions and guide borrowers toward better financial health.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, I took advantage of **Gemini’s large context window** to analyze the Kenya Financial Performance Document 2023, published by the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS). This detailed national report contains extensive economic data, including trends that influence lending performance, credit access, and default risk. Processing such a large document in its entirety allowed the model to extract contextually relevant insights—such as sector-specific risks and macroeconomic trends—that are crucial for financial institutions trying to assess lending environments more accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the system responsive to practical loan advisory needs, I applied **few-shot prompting**. By showing the model a handful of curated examples—such as how to evaluate a borrower’s spending behavior, savings discipline, or debt-to-income ratio:\n",
    "—I was able to shape its outputs to give advice that aligns with real-world lending criteria. This approach helps borrowers receive tailored financial feedback, improving their preparedness and reducing the chances of default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, I enhanced user interaction by integrating **function calling**, enabling the model to work with real-world financial data from my M-Pesa statement. For context, M-Pesa is a widely used mobile money service in Kenya that allows people to send money, pay bills, and make purchases directly from their phones. I downloaded my M-Pesa statement, converted it into a CSV, and then imported it into a SQL table. This allowed the model to run natural language queries like “How much did I spend on recurring expenses last month?” or “What is my average transaction amount?”, turning complex financial behavior into digestible insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining these techniques—large-context analysis, few-shot learning, and functional calling —this project contributes a practical solution to the growing challenge of non performning loans. It empowers individuals with AI-driven financial literacy while giving lenders smarter tools to assess creditworthiness and manage risk more proactively."

    "With a monthly income of KES 20,000 and a 12-month repayment period, it's crucial\n",
    "to apply for a loan amount that won't strain your finances. A general rule of thumb is\n",
    "to keep your loan repayments at no more than 30-40% of your monthly income. Let's\n",
    "analyze:\n",
    "Maximum Recommended Loan:\n",
    " Using the 40% rule, your maximum monthly repayment should be KES 8,000 (KES\n",
    "20,000\n",
    " 0.40). To determine the maximum loan amount, you'll need to know the interest rate\n",
    "offered by the lender. Let's assume an interest rate of 15% per annum (this is a\n",
    "common rate, but you should check with lenders for their current rates). You can use\n",
    "a loan calculator (many are available online) to determine the maximum loan amount\n",
    "that results in a monthly repayment of approximately KES 8,000 over 12 months. The\n",
    "actual amount will depend on the specific interest rate and any fees.\n",
    "Conservative Approach:\n",
    " A more conservative approach, especially given the inherent risks in business,\n",
    "would be to limit your monthly repayment to 30% of your income (KES 6,000). This\n",
    "leaves more room for unexpected expenses and ensures you can comfortably meet\n",
    "your obligations. Again, use a loan calculator to determine the corresponding loan\n",
    "amount.\n",
    "Investment Recommendations for Your Teaching Business:\n",
    "Since you're a teacher with an established business, the loan should be used to\n",
    "enhance your teaching capabilities and potentially increase your income. Here are\n",
    "some investment options:\n",
    "Improved Teaching Resources:\n",
    " Invest in high-quality teaching materials, technology (like a projector, interactive\n",
    "whiteboard, or educational software), or a comfortable and well-equipped learning\n",
    "space. This will improve the quality of your teaching and attract more students.\n",
    "Marketing and Advertising:\n",
    " Allocate funds to promote your teaching services. This could involve creating a\n",
    "professional website, running targeted online ads, distributing flyers in your\n",
    "community, or networking with schools and other institutions.\n",
    "Professional Development:\n",
    " Use some of the loan to attend workshops, conferences, or online courses to\n",
    "enhance your teaching skills and knowledge in your specific subject area. This will\n",
    "make you more competitive and attractive to potential students.\n",
    "Expansion of Services:\n",
    " If feasible, consider expanding your services. This could involve offering tutoring\n",
    "services, online courses, or workshops in addition to your regular teaching.\n",
    "Important Considerations:\n",
    "Interest Rates:\n",
    " Shop around and compare loan offers from different lenders in Kenya to find the\n",
    "best interest rate.\n",
    "Loan Fees:\n",
    " Be aware of any associated fees (processing fees, late payment penalties, etc.) and\n",
    "factor them into your calculations.\n",
    "Repayment Plan:\n",
    " Ensure you have a realistic repayment plan that aligns with your income and cash\n",
    "flow.\n",
    "Emergency Fund:\n",
    " Before taking out a loan, ensure you have an emergency fund to cover unexpected\n",
    "expenses. This will protect you if your business experiences a downturn.\n",
    "Before applying for any loan, create a detailed business plan outlining how you will\n",
