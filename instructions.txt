1. Prerequisites
Since you are using Google Colab, you don't need to install PyTorch manually, as it comes pre-installed. However, ensure the following libraries are imported in your Colab notebook:
import torch
import torchvision
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to:

Load and preprocess the dataset

Define the CNN model

Train the model

Evaluate the model

Step 4: Adjust Hyperparameters
Modify the values inside the notebook to test different configurations:

num_filters = 8  
kernel_size = 5  
learning_rate = 0.005  
num_epochs = 10  
Run the training cell again after making changes.

Select GPU

Modify your code to use GPU:

python
Copy
Edit
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model.to(device)
